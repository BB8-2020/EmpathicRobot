# Rules

## Commit rules

Every commit masseg must include the following rules:

> Summarize the change in less than 50 characters
>
> Because:
>
> * Explain the reason you made this change
> * Make a new bullet for each reason 
> * Each line should be under 72 characters 
>
> Explain exactely what was done in this commit with more depth than the 50 character subject line. Remember to warp at 72 characters! 
>
> Include any additional notes, relevent linksm or co-authors.

## Protected main

In the project you are not able to merge your changes directaly to the main branch. Because we want te make sure the code at the main clean, decently and flawless. 

When you made a change that complies with the rules, you can start a **Pull request** to the main. This pull request should be reviewed and approved by at least one teammate. 

## Branches 

The `main` branch is already secured as we told before. The only way that you can get to this branch is by opening a **Pull request**. Every pull request must include this:

* Working code 
* Numpy style docstrings 
* Pytest 
* Up to date requirements.txt

#### Developing branches

You can use/open a `developing` branch so you allowed to push directaly code into it. However pleas include this:

* Numpy style docstring 
* Up to date requirements.txt
